/* in SASS, you can make single-line comments unlike CSS
     SASS files are NOT CSS but do use CSS within them

     SASS is a CSS pre-processor
so it must be translated into CSS
for it to be parsed and processed

SASS extends the functionality of CSS
ALL CSS code is valid inside a SASS file
but not all SASS code is valid inside CSS

First it must be translated into CSS for
the browser to understand it

SASS is good for bigger projects and 
it requires good code architecture

In main.scss we import all the partial files
there shouldn't actually be any CSS in this file
only imports using @import

Sass lets you nest selectors using &

/*  7-1 design principle:
    abstracts / is for variables & other mixins that don't output CSS
    base / is for basic project definitions like CSS resets, etc.
    componenents / is for components like buttons, dropdowns, image carousels, et al
    layout / is for layouts that are repeated across multiple pages
    pages / is for info for the specific pages
    themes / is for thematic code
    vendors / is for all 3rd party CSS / code you didn't personally write
