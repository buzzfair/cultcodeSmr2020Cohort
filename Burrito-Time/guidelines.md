#Recreation Project: Burrito Time

Responsive webpage/site
Inherent "breakpoint" to display all posts and content at 1100px wide
Breakpoints at 982px wide and 758px wide

Header image adjusts at each breakpoint, and goes away entirely at the smallest
Post images adjust down slightly at the smallest

Menu and other copy is somewhat responsive with regards to layout, but not size (as could be detected)

Hover effects include background and border changes
