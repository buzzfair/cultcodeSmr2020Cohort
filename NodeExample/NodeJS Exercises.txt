Exercises for NodeJS -
- Use the Dog API to retrieve a random image of a dog and add it to the document. 
- Give this image a CSS class to make it 200px by 200px with a border-radius of 10px.
- Now, use the Dog API to retrieve five random dog images and add them to the document. Hint: use a loop!

Note that when making an API call, you'll need to figure out the following things:
- where am I making the API to? That is, what URL am I using in the request (called an endpoint)?
- how can I access the data I want? What format does it come in, and where in the response is it stored?

Lastly-
-Using the Dog API, create a slideshow that has two buttons-
one for breeds and one for sub breeds. You'll need to use the && statement that
we introduced in class yesterday for this for when you're making your API call to 
retrieve both breeds and sub breeds.

Documentation for this assignment is found here and will contain the links for your API calls.
