GOOGLE FEEDBACK
------------------------

- Overall, it looks great! There are a couple discrepancies I've noticed, but don't let this feedback take away from what is a strong recreation of the site.
- The icons in the top right are a little off-center. Since you used floats, you could have used:

position: relative;
top: 5px;
and adjust the value for the top property as needed.

The helper text ("Easily set an expiration date for your data. Turn on Auto-delete") was on two lines instead of one. 
I can't recall if this mimics the original Google site since they've changed it, 
but if you did want to put it on one line you could have added flexbox to the container:

#tagline {
    grid-area: tagline;

    display: flex;
    justify-self: center;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    width: 500px;
}
and reduce the width of the relevant row in the grid declaration to match.

- Try to get into the habit of styling by class rather than ID. 
This is more a "best practice" tip than anything really being wrong. 
In general we want to use IDs when attaching functionality and classes for styling.
