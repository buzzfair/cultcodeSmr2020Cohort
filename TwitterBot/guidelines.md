start with reproducing the code located here:

Once you've followed the tutorial, you should have experience doing two things:
- sending a GET request to retrieve several tweets based on a search
- sending a POST request to like those tweets

Using the Twitter package, accomplish the following tasks:
- use a GET request to find the 5 most recent tweets containing the phrase "ghostbusters" (or really, any phrase you like)
- using a POST request, retweet each of those tweets
